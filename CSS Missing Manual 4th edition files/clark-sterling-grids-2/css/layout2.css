<<<<<<<<<<<<< you should commit all those files so that you can reset back to them safely if you mess something up.

Technically speaking, you should commit and push every time you close a file or wrap up some important milestone.

It's like naming your save slots "Got to the end of dungeon 1", "Crafted dagger", etc. etc.
